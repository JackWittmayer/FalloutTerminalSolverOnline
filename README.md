# Fallout Terminal Solver
## What it is
Fallout terminal solver is a tool made to assist in the terminal hacking minigame present in the Fallout videogame series. The goal of the minigame is to find the correct password for the terminal. To do so, the player has to click on the words on the screen and compare the words' "likeness," or how many letters it shares with the real password, to the other words. The player only has four guesses before being locked out, so accuracy is important. This tool saves time and accuracy by perfectly comparing the words and allowing the user to find the correct password within a minute every time.

## How it works
To use this tool, first the user has to write all of the words on the terminal screen into the numbered boxes. If all the information is correct, the user can press "START HACKING" to begin the process. The tool will ask the user to click on certain words and enter their likeness into a box. This process will continue, narrowing down the list of potential passwords, until either the user gets lucky and guesses correctly, or there is only one possible password remaining.
